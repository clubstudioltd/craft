# Craft 4 Boilerplate

A scaffolding package to help you hit the ground running with your next [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) project.

## What's included?

* [Craft CMS 3](https://craftcms.com)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
* [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com)
* A sensible directory structure
* Commonly used Craft CMS plugins:

  * [Sentry](https://github.com/born05/craft-sentry/)
  * [SEOmatic](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic)

## Getting Started

Once you're happy that your server/machine meets Craft's [requirements](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/requirements.html), you can start your new project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
composer create-project clubstudioltd/craft PATH
```

This will clone a copy of this repo to your machine and automatically install any Composer dependencies.

Next, head over to the Craft [installation documentation](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/installation.html) and continue from [Step 2](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/installation.html#step-2-set-the-file-permissions).

## Developing

After setting up Craft you're ready to start building your new project! Before getting started you'll want to pull in all frontend dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can compile assets and start a watcher using:

```
npm run watch
```

That's it! Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
